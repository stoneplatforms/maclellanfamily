# Instructions for Authorizing Dropbox Access

Hi! I need you to authorize my app to access your Dropbox account so I can sync your photos to our family website.

## 🎯 What You Need to Do (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Click the Authorization Link

I'll send you a link that looks like this:
```
https://www.dropbox.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=...
```

**Click it!**

---

### Step 2: Log Into Your Dropbox

If you're not already logged in, Dropbox will ask you to sign in with:
- Your email and password
- OR via Google/Apple sign-in

**Use YOUR Dropbox account** (the one with the photos).

---

### Step 3: Click "Allow"

You'll see a page that says something like:

```
MaclellanFamily would like to:
• View files and folders in your Dropbox

[Cancel]  [Allow]
```

**Click the "Allow" button.**

---

### Step 4: Copy the Authorization Code

After clicking Allow, you'll see one of these:

**Option A: Code displayed on page**
```
Your authorization code is:

ABC123XYZ789...

Copy this code and paste it...
```

**Option B: Code in the URL**

Your browser might redirect to a page like:
```
http://localhost/?code=ABC123XYZ789...
```

The code is the long string after `code=`

---

### Step 5: Send Me the Code

**Copy the ENTIRE URL or just the code part and send it to me via:**
- Email
- Text message
- Slack/Discord
- However you want!

**Important:** 
- Send it quickly (codes expire in ~10 minutes)
- Don't share it with anyone else
- It only works once

---

## ✅ That's It!

Once I receive the code, I'll complete the setup and your photos will start syncing to the family website automatically.

---

## 🔒 What You're Authorizing

By clicking "Allow", you're giving my app permission to:
- ✅ Read files in your Dropbox (to sync photos)
- ✅ Access the folders I specify

**You can revoke this access anytime:**
1. Go to dropbox.com/account/connected_apps
2. Find "MaclellanFamily" (or my app name)
3. Click "Revoke"

---

## ❓ Questions?

### Q: Is this safe?
**A:** Yes! This is the standard OAuth process that millions of apps use. You're authorizing on Dropbox's official website, not a third-party site.

### Q: What will you see?
**A:** Only the photos in the folders we agreed on. I won't have access to your personal files unless they're in those folders.

### Q: Can I revoke it later?
**A:** Absolutely! You can revoke access anytime from your Dropbox account settings.

### Q: Will you see my password?
**A:** No! You log in directly on Dropbox's website. I never see your password.

## 🆘 Problems?

### "The link doesn't work"
- Try copying and pasting it into your browser
- Make sure the entire URL was copied
- Check that you're opening it in a web browser (not email preview)

### "I don't see a code"
- Check your browser's address bar for a URL with `code=` in it
- Look on the page for "Authorization Code" or similar text
- Take a screenshot and send it to me if you're stuck

### "It says 'Invalid client'"
- Double-check that you used the exact link I sent
- Don't modify the URL
- Let me know and I'll generate a new link

---

## 👍 Thanks!

Thanks for trusting me with access to your Dropbox! Your photos will be synced automatically and everyone can enjoy them on the family website.

**Remember:** Send me the authorization code as soon as you get it!
